If China Cracks Down on Hong Kong Will Corporate America Remember Its Morals?
Pete Buttigieg has spent much of his presidential campaign lecturing ideological opponents about being bad Christians. But every time he’s asked about abortion he refuses to address the moral questions at stake. Which is it Mayor Pete? My latest:
Corporate America has threatened and imposed economic sanctions on conservative U.S. states — even while it has embraced doing business in communist China. But what if China cracks down on Hong Kong? Will woke capitalism discover an international spine?

"Think red flags are rare in mass shooting cases? Nope. Here's a stat from a study of mass attacks in 2018:

While all eyes were on El Paso and Dayton we got a warning from the other side of the world. ISIS is starting to make a comeback:
"It would be easy to be snarky about Taylor Swift saying “rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male” while eating ""triple-cream Brie on sea-salt crackers.” But she made some other interesting remarks.

"It's been almost two years since the last significant jihadist attack in the U.S. It's been almost two years since ISIS's capital fell.

But an alarming DoD report says ISIS is rebuilding safe havens. Now is not the time to be complacent:"
Legitimate critiques of Trump get lost in the shuffle when Democrats insist he’s responsible for racial violence and label him a white supremacist. These baseless attacks offer him an easy way to avoid addressing the real case against his conduct.

It’s worse still that he obstructed the investigation into his misconduct.

Now he‘s admitted using his office to coerce another country to interfere in 2020.

I fully support the impeachment inquiry."
"So we are all clear on what’s happening: Trump admitted to asking a foreign government to open an unfounded investigation on his political opponent. He has also blocked Congress from seeing a WB complaint vetted by his own appointee as required by law.

I strongly back Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s call today for a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The American people expect truth and transparency from their government.
I fully support Congress moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. Read my full statement here:
I fully support the Speaker’s announcement of a new impeachment inquiry. The circumstances surrounding the President’s phone call with a foreign leader requires it and we are obligated to go wherever the facts lead.

It's official. Congress has now officially launched a formal impeachment inquiry into the president of the United States.
An impeachment inquiry will allow us to break through the President’s stonewalling and obstruction and get the answers the American people deserve.
But when the President of the United States is putting his personal and political interests ahead of the American people and abusing the Constitution we have a duty to investigate and follow the facts where they lead.
